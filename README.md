download use-haskell and install stack 
but it install the latest version which has a conflict. I tried to change the stack.yaml.
I changed the resolver to lit-2.22 and other extra-deps, but still bad problem.
When I use "stack setup, stack build "
coming error "Configuring ansi-terminal-0.6.2.1...
Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_1.18.1.5_ghc-7.8.4: /usr/bin/ar: permission denied"
so sent an email to demonstrator

Finally I turned into python restful services and used radon to compute the complexity
Details are in radon---cyclomatic-complexity repository
